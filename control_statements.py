"""Consider the following requirements statement:

A class of ten students took a quiz. Their grades (integers in the range 0 â€“ 100) are
98, 76, 71, 87, 83, 90, 57, 79, 82, 94. Determine the class average on the quiz.
The following script for solving this problem keeps a running total of the grades, calculates
the average and displays the result. """
